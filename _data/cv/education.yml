    My time at university consisted of lots of theory and even more practical application of programming techniques to learn about different systems.
    The two largest projects I worked on during this time period were an operating system simulator and a complete role-playing video game.

    The RPG was written in C# using the now defunct XNA framework and was fully realized in every way an RPG needs: it had complete combat, world-map, and inventory systems.
    I wrote the entire UI management stack, including things like scroll-bar support, wrap-around cursor movement, stack-based layering, and decorations.
    Following this I created the inventory and character management systems, as well as dialogue compoents and game-wide text rendering systems.
    I was also responsible for creating the navigation components necessary to do things like traverse the environment, change maps, cleanly transition to and from combat states.

    The operating system simulation project was written in C++ and involved creating a fake operating system which people could interact with to facilitate learning about how kernels implement scheduling, locking, and many other things.

    I eagerly began my M.Sc. the winter semester immediately after my graduation, but after completing the course requirements, and before my thesis, I dropped out of the program.
    I simply wasn't enjoying the research work my supervising professor assigned to me, and there was no alternative&mdash;it was either spend another year doing something I didn't enjoy or leave.
    I chose to leave.

    The only reason this is here is due to the questions I receive about the gap in time after graduating and before my first job.
