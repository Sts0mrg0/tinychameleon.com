blurb: >-
  I have large amounts of experience building cloud-based, distributed systems which
  service high-volumes of data.
  My focus is on long-term success for the company when maintaining existing,
  or building new, systems.
  I believe part of that future success depends on mentoring others to improve entire
  teams -- a rising tide lifts all boats.

  Delivering successful software solutions to business problems involves a huge amount
  of communication.
  Internal documentation of systems, especially for troubleshooting, is critical information
  that needs to be communicated for long-term success.
  Communication with stakeholders is critical to allow directors visibility into progress
  and process, so they can steer the company, as well as to customers, who want to know
  what they're getting for their money.

  Below you will find long-form information about my experience, lacking details to
  protect company secrets.
